stream-chan is a script that you can use to stream HD channels to your DLNA player of choice.  This README will describe how to set up streaming with Mediatomb. 

1) Install the hdhomerun_config utility.  

There are Debian packages, or you can get the source from here: 
http://www.silicondust.com/support/hdhomerun/downloads/linux/

2) Use hdhomerun_config to find your device ID.  ex: 

$ hdhomerun discover
hdhomerun device FFFEFDFC found at 192.168.1.12

3) Create a stream-chan.conf in the same directory as stream-chan.  Ex: 

HDHR=/usr/bin/hdhomerun_config
DEVICE=FFFEFDFC 
TUNER=0

4) Scan for TV channels in your area: 

hdhomerun_config FFFEFDFC scan 0 scan.results

5) Use make-chans to create .chan files representing those files.

./make-chans scan.results

6) Move those files into a location you'll share with Mediatomb. 

(Tip: Don't have Mediatomb running when you do this.  It might scan the .chan files before we've configured them correctly in the next step.)

mv *.chan /usr/local/share/mediatomb

7) Configure Mediatomb to "transcode" .chan files to mpeg files. 

See mediatomb.sample.config.xml

8) Start up Mediatomb and watch TV on your PS3.  :)
